## Deepsha Menghani

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
I have been a Data Scientist at Microsoft for 3 years. I have an extensive background working with varied data sets and using advanced analytics to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using reticulate, and data visualizations using animation and interactivity. I love learning new things constantly and sharing my knowledge with others in a digestible manner.

Let's name this folder "the analysis morgue." It contains more moribund analyses than it ought to because this scenario represents a common problem with data analytics teams, and by experiencing it you are not alone.
