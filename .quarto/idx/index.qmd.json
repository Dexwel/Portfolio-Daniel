I have an extensive background working with varied data sets and using advanced analytics to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions.\n\nI recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using reticulate, and data visualizations using animation and interactivity. I love learning new things constantly and sharing my knowledge with others in a digestible manner.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n![](linkedinpic.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n# Resume\n\n::: callout-tip\nYou can use your mouse to scroll through or download the pdf.

Sometimes it can tell a powerful story and sometimes it can just add some flair to an otherwise low-key story.\n\nThis blog goes through examples and code to show how easy it is to use gganimate and plotly packages to animate your data visualizations and make them interactive....

Your beautiful analysis went on to sit in a folder unseen by anybody ever again. Let's name this folder \"the analysis morgue.\" It contains more moribund analyses than it ought to because this scenario represents a common problem with data analytics teams, and by experiencing it you are not alone.\n\nBut there are ways to avoid it....
